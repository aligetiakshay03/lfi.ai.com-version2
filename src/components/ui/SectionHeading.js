/**
 * The standard section opener: eyebrow, line-revealed heading, lede.
 *
 * Every section used to hand-roll this trio, which meant the heading
 * entrance had to be re-specified each time. Centralising it is what makes
 * the reveal consistent down the page - one typographic gesture, repeated,
 * rather than nine slightly different ones.
 *
 * The heading splits into its rendered LINES and they rise out of their
 * masks in sequence. Lines rather than words was a deliberate change: at
 * section-heading size a word stagger reads as a ripple, and on a two-line
 * heading it put nine separate delays on something the eye takes in at once.

   from `publicDemos`, so the CTA promises exactly what the destination shows.
   Counting the public ones here read "30" while the page it links to said
   "33 demonstrations", because the page also lists the three internal ones
   and labels them as such. A CTA that disagrees with its own destination is
   worse than no number at all. Computed rather than written into the copy, so
   it cannot drift when a demo is added or one goes dark. */

 * recovered verbatim from the deployed lfiai.com build and therefore the
 * authoritative record of what shipped. That file declares the product set
 * explicitly:
 *
 *   const generalProductApps =
 *     ["FinSight", "Engage360", "EduPilot", "TextIQ", "vajraX",

 *   const generalPocApps = ["ConsulateSA", "ConsulateLA"];
 *
 * Two entries from that product list are deliberately NOT reproduced here,
 * and the reasons are recorded so the omissions are decisions rather than
 * oversights:
 *
 *   - "InternalPortal" (https://internal.lfidemo.com/) is reachable, but it
 *     serves a page titled "LinkFields - Internal Portal". It is a staff
 *     tool, not something a prospective customer buys, and listing it in a
 *     public product catalogue would misrepresent it.
 *   - "ConsulateSA"/"ConsulateLA" are tagged as PoCs by the source itself,
 *     and both currently return HTTP 502.
 *
 * `href: null` means there is no public build. The UI must route those to an
 * enquiry rather than invent a URL - see components/sections/Products.js.
